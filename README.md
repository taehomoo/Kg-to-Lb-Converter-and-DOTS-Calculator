# Kg-to-Lb-Converter-and-DOTS-Calculator
This small project utilizes a JFrame to create an interactive GUI to convert user-inputted values from kilos to pounds or pounds to kilos. It also calculates a DOTS score for the user. 

A DOTS (Dynamic Object Team Rating System) score is a measurement used by USA Powerlifting (USAPL) and United States Powerlifting Association (USPA) to calculate a lifter's bodyweight to total lifted score. It is used to measure performance fairly across genders and weights.

The total lifted score is calculated by combining the lifter's highest squat, bench, and deadlift performed, and using that value along with the lifter's bodyweight in the formula for the DOTS score.

The formula I used was from [here](https://www.powerlifting.sport/fileadmin/ipf/data/ipf-formula/Models_Evaluation-I-2020.pdf)
